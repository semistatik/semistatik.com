Greatness is relative.

## Thoughts on Writing

Having a personal website can be liberating. Sharing my thoughts into the world, even in the tiniest corner, still gets something out there. I have a public presence! But on the other hand, it's public. Any random stranger can view my thoughts and judge me for it. Even in the midst of writing this post, I still feel that sense of knowing that someone is going to laugh at me. I've always been self-consicious about various things, and I tend to stay pretty private, especially on the Internet. 

So why now? Why have a website, with a blog? I'm still figuring that out. I just wanted *something* out there. I took a creative writing course in college, and surprisingly, I enjoyed it. The lesson I learned out there was just write something because **the target audience is yourself, no one else**. Will someone else come along and find this? Probably. I didn't write anything for them, just me, but if they learn something, then great, kudos to me.  

### What I Want to Write

## Procrastination and ADHD
 * Why it took so long
 * Another future post on my struggles
 * Continous revisions...

## Building This Website

I earned my degree in Computer Science a few years ago, and ever since my first class in web development, I wanted a personal website. I had the knowledge of creating a basic HTML page, could make it (relatively) pretty with CSS, and could even do some minor interactivity with JavaScript. But the one concept they don't teach you in school is hosting.

Sure, the school runs a webserver for student work, but all pages are under some obscure URL and would be emphemeral. I finish school, then what? I don't have access to that server anymore. And they have no reason to keep my work availble on the server. Obviously I need it hosted elsewhere. This was a bit of a roadblock for two reasons: I didn't know how to run a server and two, I didn't really feel like paying for anything. Just out of school, I didn't care for that kind of thing yet.

Life gets in the way. I got a job out of school (doing web development incidentally), got married, and moved on with life. In my job I actually learned a few things about running a server. 

### Domains
 * Someone already owned the spencerharston.com domain...
 * How many domains do I have now?
### Hosting
 * To self-host or outsource?
### Netlify and GH Pages
 * Continuous deployment and Netlify's free tier
### Creating this Website in details
 * Eleventy and such


## The Future?

I really don't know what the future holds. This website has taken me nearly five years to get up and running. Who knows if it'll still be around in another five years?

If I've written one post every year for the next five years, I'll consider that a win.
